## To contributors

First of all ensure that you have agreed to the CLA (Contributor License Agreement)
before starting work on any library, as we cannot accept a pull request if you do not
sign the license. Use a key which is registered with your github account to sign the license.

Pull requests are only evaluated if automated checks pass, this means that your code should be:

    1. Properly formatted using goimports
    2. Pass the linter suite (we use golangcii)
    3. Pass automated tests

Your addition will be evaluated on style, overall quality and extension of the testsuite.
